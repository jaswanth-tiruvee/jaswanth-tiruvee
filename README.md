## 🔎 About Me

I'm a Master's graduate in Data Science from the **University at Buffalo**, with real-world experience in **AI**, **machine learning**, **ETL engineering**, and **cloud-based analytics**. I specialize in applying data science to impactful domains like **healthcare**, **NLP**, **automation**, and **interactive AI systems**.

I thrive at the intersection of research and deployment — from developing emotion recognition models and chatbots to optimizing ETL pipelines and building workflow automations.
